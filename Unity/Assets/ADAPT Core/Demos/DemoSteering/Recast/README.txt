This is a demo of the full steering system with leg animation for the mannequins. In particular, look at the Manager's SteeringManager component, and the ADAPTMan SteeringComponent component. The leg animation system is independent and works purely on the velocity of the agent and the environment (but is configured to treat only the "Ground" layer as ground in this scene) -- you can learn more about the legs in the DemoLocomotion demo.

A navmesh can be generated by the ADAPT->Navmesh Builder menu option. Configure the navmesh builder by picking its extent (you can drag the green gizmo box on-screen to make sure it encompasses the entire relevant terrain) and configure the parameters (described in the detour/recast docs). In order for terrain to be considered by the navmesh builder, it must be marked as static in Unity. See GatherColliders() in NavmeshBuilder.cs for all of the geometry selection criteria. Once you generate the navmesh, you can delete the Navmesh builder. The Steering Manager needs a reference to the active navmesh, which can be set in the inspector.

The agent's SteeringComponent is largely drag-and-drop with some minor configuration. It will automatically find the SteeringManager (but there can only be one active SteeringManager in the scene). Holding radius is the radius at which the agent will hold its position from the target. Arriving radius is the radius at which the agent will look at the target and begin to slow down.

There's one runner in the crowd, who has been given a running animation and a higher max speed.
